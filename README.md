# Project Todos
 
The assignment was to create a TO-DO list app using Redux.
 
## The problem
 
As per Maria Pogosjan's recommendation, I used the npm library Material-UI as a base. It took longer than expected to get into, but I think it was good practice and will help me in future projects. I hope to be more consistent about styling methods in the future, because here I mix CSS and styling with props a lot. If I had more time I would definitely go back and refactor the styling to use mainly one approach.
 
I also wanted to add time estimates for how long the user thinks a new task might take, but I ran out of time. I unfortunately had little time this week, so I hope to return to this project to add functionality.
